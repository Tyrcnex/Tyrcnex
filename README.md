I'm Tyrcnex. I'm a Javascript hobbyist programmer, though I'm learning Rust now. Fun fact: you can get my name by removing the p from "encrypt", adding an x at the front, and reversing the result.

I also spend a lot of time on Desmos, Tetris, and Discord (you can contact me: @tyrcnex). I also like puzzles, but what I love more than puzzles is automating them so that I don't have to solve the puzzles myself ;)
