Hi! I'm Tyrcnex. You can get my name by removing the p from "encrypt", adding an x at the front, and reversing the result.

I'm not that experienced with a variety of programming, but I believe I'm okayish at making Discord bots (my favorite achievement being that I recreated the entire Dank Memer adventure command)
Here are my stats (the world is a video game, prove me wrong):

- Age: 14 y/o
- Pronouns: he/they
- Programming experience: Scratch since 7, Javascript since 12, have been making Discord bots ever since
- Math nerd

Thank you for reading my README.md, please like and subscribe.
